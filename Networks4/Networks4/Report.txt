1)The development and the correctness of all the frameworks can be noticed by
 running the API and by tracking the Trace,Statistics window,we can see the
 real time statistics of the frame transfer at a low frequency and also see the
 printf() statements at regular intervals for debugging and thereby the correctness
 of the frameworks can be known.

2)There can be two possibilities of failure of Simple ARQ protocol.One is that the  
frame is completely lost and the other is that lets say the sender sends frame i 
and the receiver recieves that frame i .The ack sent by it ,if damaged then the 
sender resends it because the timeout time is over.The ithee frame is resend and as the 
receiver was expecting the i+1th frame,it rejects it and this process continues for ever.


3)The selective repeat protocol will fail if the number of frames exceeds the MaxSeq/2 when 
the buffer of the receiver due to timeouts and errors have multiple copies of same frames
at regular intervals.So, in a way,it is stuck in a loop which leads the protocol failure.	


4) simple_ARQ.c implements the cimple ARQ protocol with one sender and one receiver.
   
5) sliding_window_1bit.c implements the sliding window protocol with the receiver window of size 1 bit.
 
6) Go_back_N.c implements the Go-Back-N protocol variant with unit frame receiver window.
   
7) selective_repeat.c implements the Selective-Repeat ARQ protocol variant with multi-frame receiver window.

8) sliding_window_1bit_throughput has the throughput V/S probabilty plot

9) Go_back_throughput has the similar plot and also selective_repeat_throughput.dat as well

10)The window size V/S throughput plot is int Throuhput_Window.dat
